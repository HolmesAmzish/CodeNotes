    "texts = \"This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the data set MedPix 2.0. Starting from the well-known multimodal dataset MedPixÂ®, mainly used by physicians, nurses and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure where noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the dataset, we developed a GUI aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance, and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning MLLMs. To enforce this point, we also propose a CLIP-based model trained on MedPix 2.0 for scan classification tasks.\"\n",
